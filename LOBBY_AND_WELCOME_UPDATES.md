# Lobby and Welcome Screen Updates

## Overview
The lobby and welcome screens have been completely updated to match the home.tsx layout while restricting certain actions for non-authenticated users. This ensures that users without accounts can browse products and services but cannot perform actions that require authentication.

## Changes Made

### 1. Lobby Screen (`ecommerce-app/app/lobby.tsx`)
- **Layout**: Now matches the home.tsx layout exactly with tabs for Products and Services
- **Real Data**: Fetches real products and services from the backend
- **Fallback Data**: Uses mock data when backend doesn't have products/services
- **Search Functionality**: Full search across products and services
- **Category Filtering**: Dynamic category filtering for both products and services
- **Restricted Actions**: All interactive actions show login prompts

#### Features for Non-Authenticated Users:
- ✅ Browse all products and services
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Category filtering
- ✅ View product/service details (shows login prompt)
- ✅ See ratings and reviews
- ❌ Add to cart (shows login prompt)
- ❌ Rate products (shows login prompt)
- ❌ Add to favorites (shows login prompt)
- ❌ Make purchases

#### Login Prompts:
- Product/Service clicks → "Sign In Required" alert
- Add to cart → "Sign In Required" alert
- Rating → "Sign In Required" alert
- Favorites → "Sign In Required" alert

### 2. Welcome Screen (`ecommerce-app/app/welcome.tsx`)
- **Enhanced Design**: More engaging with feature cards
- **Feature Highlights**: Shows 4 key features of the platform
- **Modern UI**: Gradient buttons and improved visual hierarchy
- **Better Navigation**: Clear call-to-action to proceed to lobby

### 3. Mock Data (`ecommerce-app/utils/mockData.ts`)
- **Sample Products**: 6 premium products with realistic data
- **Sample Services**: 6 professional services with realistic data
- **Fallback System**: Ensures lobby always has content to display

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses Zustand stores for products, services, theme, and currency
- Fetches real data on component mount
- Falls back to mock data when backend is empty

### Authentication Flow
- All restricted actions trigger Alert.alert with login options
- Users can choose to Sign In or Sign Up
- Seamless navigation to authentication screens

### Responsive Design
- Tab-based navigation between Products and Services
- Horizontal scrolling category lists
- Grid layouts for products and services
- Consistent with home.tsx styling

## Building APK with Expo CLI

### Prerequisites
1. Install Expo CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g @expo/cli
```

2. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
cd ecommerce-app
npm install
```

### Build Commands

#### 1. Build APK for Android
```bash
cd ecommerce-app
expo build:android
```

#### 2. Build AAB (Android App Bundle) for Play Store
```bash
cd ecommerce-app
expo build:android --type app-bundle
```

#### 3. Build with Custom Configuration
```bash
cd ecommerce-app
expo build:android --clear-cache
```

### Build Configuration
The app.json file should have the following Android configuration:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yourapp.aura",
      "versionCode": 1,
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#0A0A0A"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting
- If build fails, try clearing cache: `expo build:android --clear-cache`
- Ensure all assets are properly configured in app.json
- Check that all dependencies are compatible with Expo SDK version

## User Experience

### For Non-Authenticated Users:
1. **Welcome Screen**: Engaging introduction with feature highlights
2. **Lobby Screen**: Full marketplace preview with real products/services
3. **Interactive Elements**: Clear feedback when actions require authentication
4. **Easy Onboarding**: Simple path to create account or sign in

### Benefits:
- Users can explore the platform before committing
- Real product/service data gives authentic experience
- Clear authentication requirements prevent confusion
- Professional appearance builds trust
